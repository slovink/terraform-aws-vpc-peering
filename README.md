## Introduction

This module is designed for peering two Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using AWS infrastructure. It provides a streamlined way to create a VPC peering connection between two VPCs in the `eu-west-1` region. The module is customizable and can be easily integrated into your Terraform infrastructure.

## Usage

To use this module, you should have Terraform installed and configured for AWS. This module provides the necessary Terraform configuration for creating AWS resources, and you can customize the inputs as needed. Below is an example of how to use this module## examples

# Example: default
```hcl
module "vpc-peering" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/slovink/terraform-aws-vpc-peering.git?ref=v1.0.0"
  name             = local.name
  environment      = local.environment
  requestor_vpc_id = "vpc-045eae4d6b443a318"
  acceptor_vpc_id  = "vpc-04cb13c74100e2e90"
}
```

# Example: multi-region

```hcl
module "vpc-peering" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/slovink/terraform-aws-vpc-peering.git?ref=v1.0.0"
  name             = "vpc-peering"
  environment      = "prod"
  label_order      = ["environment", "name"]
  requestor_vpc_id = "vpc-0dafb7e1998d88788"
  acceptor_vpc_id  = "vpc-009adfebb640d4509"
  accept_region    = "us-east-1"
  auto_accept      = false
}
```

## Module Inputs

The following inputs can be configured when using this module:

- `name` (string): A name for the peering configuration.
- `environment` (string): The environment in which the peering connection is being created.
- `requestor_vpc_id` (string): The ID of the VPC that initiates the peering request.
- `acceptor_vpc_id` (string): The ID of the VPC that accepts the peering request.
- `label_order` (list of strings): The order in which labels should be applied to the peering connection.
- `accept_region` (string): The AWS region where the accepting VPC is located.
- `auto_accept` (bool): Whether to automatically accept the peering request (true/false).


## Module Outputs

This module provides no specific outputs.
- id - The ID of the VPC Peering Connection.
- accept_status - The status of the VPC Peering Connection request.
- tags - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource.
